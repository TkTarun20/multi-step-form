## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- ARIA roles and properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For flexible form inputs and validation

### What I learned

In this project, I learnt how to use [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) library for multi-step form, and further enhanced my knowledge about this library. It is a way much better than manually handling form's validtion through `Constraint Validation API` which requires a lot of effort.
